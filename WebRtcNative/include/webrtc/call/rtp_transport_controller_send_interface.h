// An RtpTransportController should own everything related to the RTP
// transport to/from a remote endpoint. We should have separate
// interfaces for send and receive side, even if they are implemented
// by the same class. This is an ongoing refactoring project. At some
// point, this class should be promoted to a public api under
// webrtc/api/rtp/.
//
// For a start, this object is just a collection of the objects needed
// by the VideoSendStream constructor. The plan is to move ownership
// of all RTP-related objects here, and add methods to create per-ssrc
// objects which would then be passed to VideoSendStream. Eventually,
// direct accessors like packet_router() should be removed.
//
// This should also have a reference to the underlying
// webrtc::Transport(s). Currently, webrtc::Transport is implemented by
// WebRtcVideoChannel2 and WebRtcVoiceMediaChannel, and owned by
// WebrtcSession. Video and audio always uses different transport
// objects, even in the common case where they are bundled over the
// same underlying transport.
//
// Extracting the logic of the webrtc::Transport from BaseChannel and
// subclasses into a separate class seems to be a prerequesite for
// moving the transport here.
